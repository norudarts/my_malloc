# my_malloc

A personal malloc (+ free & realloc) implementation written in a few days for a 2nd year EPITECH (2010-2011) project.

## Details

Although far from being perfect, implementing my own version of malloc helped me a lot to understand even more how memory management works in details.

I was able to run my entire OS in normal conditions by replacing the system malloc implementation with this one.
This implementation was developed for Linux (Fedora) and was never updated since 2011.

## Usage

Run the Makefile to compile the `libmy_malloc.so`:

```bash
$ make
```

## Project results

This project got me the sweet mark of 22 out of 20 at the time :)
